"""
8-9. Messages: Make a list containing a series of short text messages. Pass the list to a function
called show_messages(), which prints each text message.
8-10. Sending Messages: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 8-9. Write a
function called send_messages() that prints each text message and moves each message to a
new list called sent_messages as itâ€™s printed. After calling the function, print both of your lists
to make sure the messages were moved correctly.
8-11. Archived Messages: Start with your work from Exercise 8-10. Call the function
send_messages() with a copy of the list of messages. After calling the function, print both of
your lists to show that the original list has retained its messages.
